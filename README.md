## [Project 1: Industrial Energy Combustion Model](https://github.com/RonitMalik/BlackFriday_pythonScrapper)

In this project I build Carrier's Performance for a US Airline dataset.

* It provides the most precise analytics to enable airlines to optimize planning, operations and passenger services.
* Gives detailed view of Carrier's Load Factor.
* Have seach functionality of Flights between Source and Destination.
* Shows total Flights for each Distance Groups.
* Helps to measure airline on-time performance and gain insights with industry data.

In this project I build Carrier's Performance for a US Airline dataset.

* It provides the most precise analytics to enable airlines to optimize planning, operations and passenger services.
* Gives detailed view of Carrier's Load Factor.
* Have seach functionality of Flights between Source and Destination.
* Shows total Flights for each Distance Groups.
* Helps to measure airline on-time performance and gain insights with industry data.
* The model is build on: Excel, PowerBI and Tableau.
* MySQL is used to create views, Stored Procedures, etc
