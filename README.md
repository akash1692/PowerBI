## [Project 1: Industrial Energy Combustion Model](https://github.com/ermakash/Akash-s_Analytics_Portfolio)

This Project is about in-depth facility-level information on industrial combustion energy use in the United States. 

* It provides an essential resource for understanding consumption patterns across different sectors and industries 
* It serves as an informative baseline for efficient or renewable alternative plans of operation at these facilities. 
* Gives detailed information on Facility, fuel type, Primary NAICS, MMBtu and GWht.
* **MySQL**: Remove unwanted columns, null values and created view tables
* **PowerBI** and **Tableau**: Created a fully functional integrated dashboard as per business requirements

## [Project 2: Airline Performance Model](https://github.com/ermakash/Akash-s_Analytics_Portfolio)

In this project I build Carrier's Performance for a United States Airline dataset.

* It provides the most precise analytics to enable airlines to optimize planning, operations and passenger services.
* Gives detailed view of Carrier's Load Factor.
* Have seach functionality of Flights between Source and Destination.
* Shows total Flights for each Distance Groups.
* Helps to measure airline on-time performance and gain insights with industry data.
* The model is build on: **Excel**, **PowerBI** and **Tableau**.
* **MySQL** is used to create views, Stored Procedures, etc

## [Project 3: Banking Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/ermakash/Akash-s_Analytics_Portfolio)

In this project I analyse the data and bring out few insights on the Customer Churn..

* It allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.
* Took data from multiple source and created a Star Schema Model
* Implemented coutry wise RLS.
* Manage subscription and alerts in powerBI Service
* Created an app as per business requirement.
* The model is build on: **PowerBI**
